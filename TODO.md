# Hip-Hop Hangman GUI Integration TODO

## Plan Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Refactor main.go
- [x] Extract game logic functions from main() into reusable functions
- [x] Move game state variables to be accessible by GUI
- [x] Update main() to call createGUI() instead of CLI game

### Step 2: Enhance gui.go
- [x] Add category selection UI
- [x] Add game board display (word state, hangman drawing, guessed letters)
- [x] Add input field for guesses
- [x] Add game state management
- [x] Implement win/lose screens
- [x] Add scoring display

### Step 3: Testing
- [x] Test the GUI application
- [x] Ensure all game features work in GUI mode
- [x] Verify file loading and category selection works
- [x] Test core game logic functions
- [x] Test word loading from files
- [x] Test game state management
- [x] Test guess processing (single letters and full words)
- [x] Test duplicate guess prevention
- [x] Test hangman art generation
- [x] Test category statistics loading
- [x] Test complete game flow scenarios (win/lose)
- [x] Test input validation and edge cases
- [x] Test performance with multiple games
- [x] Test UI enhancements (larger input field)

## Current Status
- ✅ Step 1 Complete: Refactored main.go with reusable game logic
- ✅ Step 2 Complete: Enhanced gui.go with full game integration
- ✅ Step 3 Complete: Comprehensive testing completed successfully

## Implementation Summary

### Fixed Import Issues:
- ✅ Removed unused imports from gui.go
- ✅ Fixed loop syntax error in category selection
- ✅ Integrated GUI with game logic from main.go

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Category selection with artist counts (7 categories, 330+ total artists)
- ✅ Interactive game board with word display
- ✅ Hangman ASCII art display (6 stages)
- ✅ Large, prominent guess input field (500x60 pixels) with clear labeling
- ✅ Score tracking and attempts counter
- ✅ Win/lose dialogs with play again option
- ✅ Full word and single letter guessing
- ✅ Duplicate guess prevention

### Technical Improvements:
- ✅ Extracted reusable game logic functions
- ✅ Created GameState struct for state management
- ✅ Implemented proper GUI architecture with GameGUI struct
- ✅ Added error handling for file operations
- ✅ Made main() call createGUI() by default
- ✅ Enhanced UI with larger input field for better user experience

### Testing Results:
- ✅ **Word Loading**: Successfully loads random words from all category files
- ✅ **Game Initialization**: Properly creates game state with correct initial values
- ✅ **Letter Guessing**: Correctly processes single letter guesses (e.g., "A" found in "LAURYN HILL")
- ✅ **Wrong Guesses**: Properly decrements attempts for incorrect guesses (e.g., "Z")
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Correctly handles duplicate letter guesses
- ✅ **Hangman Art**: Generates appropriate ASCII art based on remaining attempts
- ✅ **Category Stats**: All 7 categories load with correct artist counts:
  - East Coast: 91 artists
  - West Coast: 47 artists  
  - South: 102 artists
  - Midwest: 30 artists
  - International: 11 artists
  - Groups: 6 artists
  - All Artists: 330 artists
- ✅ **GUI Application**: Launches successfully with Fyne interface
- ✅ **Build Process**: Compiles without errors

The application now successfully runs with a fully functional GUI interface and all core game mechanics working correctly!
